First and foremost, I am a computational materials scientist. Multiscale simulation is my research tool with which I design and characterize materials. My current research is multi/crossdisciplinary, ranging from solids to biopolymers and bio-nano interface. Antibiofouling zwitterionic polymers, protein-nanoparticle interaction, 2D-chiral hybrid perovskites, multinary-oxides and chalcogenides-based PV/PEC solar absorbers, and high-entropy materials-based ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) are the topics of my current focus. Below are my research vision, interests, and highlights. Explore more on ```Research```.
