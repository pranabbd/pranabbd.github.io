First and foremost, I am a computational materials scientist, and multiscale simulation is my research tool. Using the tool, I both design and characterize materials. My research covers various topics, ranging from solar energy conversion (PV and PEC) and ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) to bio-nano interface and antibiofouling coating. Multinary-oxides and chalcogenides, high-entropy ceramics, zwitterionic polymers, and 2D-hybrid perovskites are my current interests.
