First and foremost, I am a computational materials scientist. Multiscale simulation is my research tool with which I design and characterize materials. Currently, I am a postdoc with multi/crossdisciplinary research expertiseâ€”my areas of research interest range from solids to biopolymers and bio-nano interface. Antibiofouling zwitterionic polymers, protein-nanoparticle interaction, 2D-chiral hybrid perovskites, multinary-oxides/chalcogenides-based PV/PEC solar absorbers, and high-entropy ceramics are my current focus. Below are my research vision, interests, and highlights. Explore more on ```Research```.
