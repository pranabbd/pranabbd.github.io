Welcome to my multiscale simulation lab, an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Framework (ICMEF), with the vision of facilitating the faster development of novel materials. Through the ICMEF, my lab focuses on materials discovery and advancement via ab initio materials design and multiscale characterization. My multiscale characterization aims at understanding the cross-disciplinary science of materials at macroscopic (technological interest) and microscopic (the underlying interactions in the system) levels.
